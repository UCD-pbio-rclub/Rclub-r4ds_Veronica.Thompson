**1. Brainstorm at least 5 different ways to assess the typical delay characteristics of a group of flights. Consider the following scenarios:**  
*A flight is 15 minutes early 50% of the time, and 15 minutes late 50% of the time.  
*A flight is always 10 minutes late.  
*A flight is 30 minutes early 50% of the time, and 30 minutes late 50% of the time.  
*99% of the time a flight is on time. 1% of the time itâ€™s 2 hours late.
